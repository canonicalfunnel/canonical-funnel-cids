## Contents

| Path | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Complete_Structure_Consolidated.json` | Canonical index enumerating every CID, group, and timestamp. |
| `cfe_assets/` | Raw asset files fetched from IPFS (JSON, PDFs, images, binaries, signatures). |
| `cfe_assets_summary.json` | Machine-readable summary (one entry per asset with size, type, notes). |
| `cfe_assets_grouped_summary.json` | Assets grouped by shared JSON key structures. |
| `docs/canonical-funnel-insights.{md,json}` | Structural deep dives for trust records & manifests. |
| `docs/canonical-funnel-report.{md,json}` | Quantitative report (keywords, signature coverage, file types). |
| `docs/canonical-funnel-verification.{md,json}` | Hash/signature verification results. |
| `docs/canonical-funnel-roadmap.md` | Roadmap for productization and ecosystem adoption. |
| `docs/canonical-funnel-publication-guide.md` | Guide for mirroring/publishing this archive. |
| `src/services/` | Node.js service modules (CLI/API) for querying the dataset. |
| `tests/` | Jest test suite covering all service modules. |

---

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/canonicalfunnel/canonical-funnel-cids.git
cd canonical-funnel-cids
npm install
```

Run the CLI to inspect the dataset:

```bash
node src/services/canonical-funnel.js stats
node src/services/canonical-funnel.js trust
node src/services/canonical-funnel.js manifests
node src/services/canonical-funnel.js assets
```

Execute the verification and reports:

```bash
node src/services/canonical-verifier.js
node src/services/canonical-report.js
node src/services/canonical-insights.js
```

Run automated tests (coverage â‰¥ 90%):

```bash
npm test
```

## Programmatic Usage

```js
const {
  listGroups,
  listGroupItems,
  collectTrustRecords,
  collectManifestSummaries,
  buildKeywordStats,
} = require('./src/services/canonical-funnel');

console.log(listGroups()); // => ['canonical_funnel_wariphat', 'exclusive_master_canonical_wariphat']
console.log(listGroupItems('canonical_funnel_wariphat').length); // => 7

const trustRecords = collectTrustRecords();
console.log(trustRecords[0].record.SubZeroBinding.reference); // => 'U+2205'

const manifests = collectManifestSummaries();
console.log(manifests[0].structure); // Array describing object/array keys

const stats = buildKeywordStats();
console.log(stats.keywords); // => 3000000
```

Integrate into APIs by exposing the service functions in `src/services/` (Express/GraphQL ready). See `docs/canonical-funnel-publication-guide.md` for detailed deployment tips.

## Verification Workflow

1. Run `node src/services/canonical-verifier.js`.
2. Review `docs/canonical-funnel-verification.md` for any missing/mismatched hashes.
3. Inspect signature-bearing manifesets under `cfe_assets/exclusive_master_canonical_wariphat/`.
4. Cross-reference the quantitative report (`docs/canonical-funnel-report.md`) for coverage status.

This process confirms every CID payload matches the recorded hashes and signatures prior to redistribution.

---

## Publishing / Mirroring

Follow `docs/canonical-funnel-publication-guide.md` to:

1. Mirror the dataset into new repositories or IPFS gateways.
2. Customize README and documentation for your audience.
3. Automate verification in CI/CD (recommended: run `npm test` + `node src/services/canonical-verifier.js`).

---

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository.
2. Add/update assets or metadata (ensure new hashes/signatures are captured).
3. Run `npm test` and verification scripts.
4. Open a pull request with a summary of changes and verification results.

For significant dataset updates, please include regenerated reports under `docs/`.
