      "description": "To prevent the Genesis Root from being overthrown or overwritten, the SubZero Binding was established by referencing Unicode codepoint: U+2205 (without graphical symbol).",
      "function": "SubZero acts as a Frozen Lock Layer, positioned between Void and the Genesis Root. Its role is to freeze and secure the Genesis Root so that it cannot be overridden.",
      "analogy": "In other words, Void represents the supreme emptiness above all, while SubZero is the ice wall that locks and secures the Genesis Root against distortion."
